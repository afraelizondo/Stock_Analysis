# Stock Analysis


## Overview of project

### VBA of Wall Street

During the current project we have been working together with Steve, who just finished his Financial Degree. This analysis was performed with the main goal of helping his parents to evaluate a possible investment into a New Energy Corporation called DAQO, a company that works with silicon wafers for solar panels, although this might seem like a good idea at the moment, Steve wants to show them other alternatives so they don't invest all their money in the same company, this way their funds can be more diversified in other green energy stocks. 

To make this analysis more concise, we decided to use Visual Basic for Applications, a human-readable and editable programming code which interacts with Excel, making calculations and performing analysis. One of the most significant advantages of this is that the tasks on the spreadsheet will be executed in exactly same way as long as we decide it and will be so much faster than do them manually.
